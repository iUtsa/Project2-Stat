## Introduction

Nimbus AI Plot-Salt-Smooth-Graph (PSS) is an advanced data processing and visualization platform designed for scientists, researchers, and data analysts who need to extract meaningful patterns from noisy time-series data. The system implements a novel four-stage pipeline that enhances signal detection through a combination of plotting, controlled data perturbation ("salting"), adaptive smoothing, and comparative visualization.

The PSS pipeline was developed based on extensive research in signal processing, data visualization, and human perception of patterns. This approach has proven particularly effective for datasets with subtle patterns obscured by noise or datasets where traditional smoothing algorithms might dampen important features.

Key features of the Nimbus AI PSS system include:

- Interactive web interface with natural language processing capabilities
- Advanced adaptive Solter smoothing algorithm with configurable parameters
- Intelligent data salting procedures that enhance pattern visibility
- Multi-stage visualization pipeline for comparative analysis
- Comprehensive session management for multi-user environments
- Export capabilities for processed data and visualizations
- Detailed statistical analysis and data exploration tools

## System Architecture

Nimbus AI PSS uses a hybrid architecture that combines the processing power of Java with the flexibility and accessibility of Python:

1. **Frontend Layer**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript web interface for user interaction
2. **Application Layer**: Flask-based Python server handling HTTP requests, session management, and coordination
3. **Processing Layer**: Java-based processing engine for the core PSS pipeline
4. **Storage Layer**: File-based storage for data, visualizations, and session information

The system is designed for modularity, allowing each component to be updated or replaced independently. The Java processing engine is accessed through subprocess calls from the Python application, with data passing through standardized CSV formats.

## Core Components

### The Plot-Salt-Smooth-Graph Pipeline

The PSS Pipeline is a four-stage process designed to enhance pattern detection in time-series data:

1. **Plot**: The initial data is visualized to establish a baseline for comparison. This stage includes automatic detection of data characteristics like trends, cycles, and noise levels.

2. **Salt**: Controlled perturbation is applied to the data based on its characteristics. This "salting" process is designed to enhance patterns through controlled amplification of certain features.

3. **Smooth**: The Solter adaptive smoothing algorithm is applied to reduce noise while preserving important features. The algorithm automatically adjusts parameters based on local data characteristics.

4. **Graph**: The original, salted, and smoothed data are visualized together for comparative analysis, allowing researchers to identify patterns that might be missed with traditional approaches.

Each stage produces both data and visualizations, which are stored for reference and available through the API and user interface.

### Solter Smoothing Algorithm

The Solter smoothing algorithm is a novel approach developed specifically for the PSS pipeline. It combines elements of weighted moving averages, kernel smoothing, and adaptive filtering techniques.

Key features of the Solter algorithm include:

- **Adaptive Window Size**: The algorithm automatically adjusts the window size based on local data variability.
- **Weighted Averaging**: Points are weighted based on both distance and value similarity, similar to bilateral filtering in image processing.
- **Feature Preservation**: Unlike traditional smoothing methods, Solter smoothing is designed to preserve important features like peaks, valleys, and inflection points.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Alpha (controlling distance weight decay) and Beta (controlling overall smoothing intensity) can be adjusted for different data types.

The implementation uses a sliding window approach with exponential weight decay, modified to reduce the impact of outliers and preserve significant features.

### Data Salting Procedure

Data salting is a unique feature of the PSS pipeline that enhances pattern visibility through controlled data perturbation. Unlike random noise addition, salting is based on detected data characteristics:

- **Trend Enhancement**: For data with detected trends, salting amplifies the trend direction with small, systematic variations.
- **Cycle Enhancement**: For periodic data, salting adds harmonics that enhance the visibility of cyclic patterns.
- **Contrast Enhancement**: For data with distinct levels, salting increases the separation between levels while maintaining within-level consistency.
- **Feature Highlighting**: For sparse features, salting can be concentrated around potential points of interest.

The salting procedure is carefully calibrated to avoid introducing false patterns while enhancing existing but subtle patterns. This approach has proven particularly effective for datasets where traditional smoothing alone might miss important features.

- 404: Resource not found
- 500: Server error

Error responses include a descriptive message:

```json
{
  "error": "Detailed error message"
}
```

Detailed error information is logged server-side for debugging, while user-facing error messages are kept appropriately general to avoid exposing sensitive system details.

## User Interface

### Chat Interface

The Nimbus AI PSS system features a conversational interface that allows users to interact with the system using natural language. The chat interface supports a variety of commands:

- Requesting visualizations: "Show me the salted plot"
- Data exploration: "Tell me about my data"
- Explanation requests: "Explain the smoothing algorithm"
- Help and guidance: "What can you do?"

The system uses pattern matching and keyword extraction to interpret user requests, with fallback mechanisms for ambiguous queries.

### Visualization Display

Visualizations are displayed in a dedicated area of the user interface, with options for:

- Zooming and panning
- Downloading as PNG images
- Toggling between different pipeline stages
- Adjusting display parameters (line thickness, colors, etc.)

The visualization system uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering, with fallback to static image display for browsers with limited capabilities.

### Data Exploration

Raw and processed data can be explored through the interface:

- Tabular data display with pagination
- Basic statistical summaries
- Highlighting of significant features
- Filtering and sorting options

For large datasets, the system implements progressive loading to maintain responsiveness.

## Session Management

### Session Creation and Tracking

Nimbus AI PSS implements a comprehensive session management system:

1. **Session Creation**: A new session is created for each file upload, with a unique UUID assigned.
2. **Session Storage**: Session data is stored in server memory with references to file paths.
3. **Client Tracking**: The session ID is stored in both cookies and included in all API requests.
4. **Session Validation**: Each request is validated against the sessions dictionary to ensure legitimacy.

Sessions include metadata about the processing stage, file information, and generated assets.

### Multi-User Support

The system supports concurrent users with isolated sessions:

- Each user receives a unique session ID
- File uploads and processing are isolated by session
- Visualizations are stored in session-specific directories
- Memory management ensures fair resource allocation

The server tracks active sessions and implements cleanup procedures for abandoned sessions.

### Session Persistence

While the current implementation stores session data in memory, the system is designed to support persistent session storage:

- Sessions can be serialized to disk for persistence across server restarts
- Database integration can be added for scaled deployments
- Session expiration and cleanup processes prevent resource exhaustion

For production deployments, it's recommended to implement a database-backed session store for reliability.

## Advanced Features

### Advanced Smoothing Techniques

Beyond the default Solter smoothing, Nimbus AI PSS supports several advanced smoothing techniques:

- **Multi-Pass Smoothing**: Applying the smoothing algorithm multiple times with varying parameters
- **Adaptive Window Smoothing**: Dynamically adjusting window size based on local data characteristics
- **Bilateral Smoothing**: Preserving edges while smoothing noise, adapted from image processing
- **Savitzky-Golay Filtering**: Polynomial fitting within a sliding window
- **Gaussian Kernel Smoothing**: Using Gaussian-weighted averages for noise reduction

These techniques can be selected via configuration or requested through the chat interface with specific parameters.

### Export and Sharing Options

Processed data and visualizations can be exported in various formats:

- CSV files with original and processed data
- PNG/JPG images of visualizations
- PDF reports with data summaries and visualizations
- Shareable links for collaborative analysis (with appropriate security measures)

The export system is extensible, allowing new formats to be added as needed.

### Custom Visualization Parameters

Advanced users can customize visualization parameters:

- Color schemes for different data series
- Line styles and point markers
- Axis scaling and labels
- Grid lines and reference levels
- Annotation of significant features

These customizations can be set through configuration files or requested via the chat interface.

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies

Nimbus AI PSS implements several caching strategies to improve performance:

- **Visualization Caching**: Generated images are cached and reused when possible
- **Processed Data Caching**: Intermediates from the PSS pipeline are stored for quick access
- **Analysis Caching**: Statistical analyses are computed once and cached for reuse

Cache invalidation occurs when new files are uploaded or processing parameters are changed.

### Asynchronous Processing

Resource-intensive operations are handled asynchronously:

- File processing is performed in background threads
- Long-running Java processes are monitored for completion
- Progress updates are provided through the user interface
- Timeouts are implemented to prevent resource exhaustion

This approach ensures the user interface remains responsive even during complex processing tasks.

### Resource Management

The system includes several resource management features:

- **Memory Monitoring**: Java heap size is controlled to prevent out-of-memory errors
- **Disk Space Management**: Temporary files are cleaned up after processing
- **Processing Limits**: Maximum file sizes and processing times are enforced
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: The system balances requests across available resources

For production deployments, additional resource management through container orchestration is recommended.

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation

All user inputs are validated to prevent security issues:

- **File Validation**: Only CSV files of acceptable size are processed
- **Parameter Validation**: All processing parameters are validated and sanitized
- **Query Validation**: Chat queries are parsed and validated before processing
- **Path Validation**: All file paths are normalized and validated to prevent directory traversal

Input validation occurs at multiple levels, from client-side checks to server-side validation.

### Session Protection

Sessions are protected from unauthorized access:

- **Secure Session IDs**: Session IDs are generated using cryptographically secure methods
- **Session Validation**: Each request is validated against the sessions dictionary
- **Session Timeout**: Inactive sessions expire after a configurable period
- **Session Isolation**: Each session has isolated storage for files and visualizations

For production deployments, additional security measures like HTTPS and secure cookies should be implemented.

### File Upload Security

File uploads include several security measures:

- **Size Limits**: Maximum file size is enforced to prevent DoS attacks
- **Type Validation**: File types are validated by content, not just extension
- **Storage Isolation**: Uploaded files are stored in session-specific directories
- **Sanitization**: Filenames are sanitized to prevent injection attacks

All file operations use secure methods to prevent common vulnerabilities.

## Development and Extensions

### Adding New Algorithms

The PSS pipeline is designed for extensibility, allowing new algorithms to be added:

1. Implement the algorithm in the Java processing engine
2. Update the command-line interface to support the new algorithm
3. Add appropriate API endpoints and documentation
4. Update the chat interface to recognize requests for the new algorithm

A consistent interface for algorithm implementations ensures compatibility with the broader system.
